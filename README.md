# Pricelist
Easily share product prices with your customers without the need to create a quotation.

This module improves the price list feature in Odoo by allowing you to create and print price lists in both PDF and XLS formats. It is designed for customers outside the regular sales process and helps salespeople see the product price list and cost price before setting final prices.

Key Features:                
EN/AR Description: Add product descriptions in both Arabic and English.
Easy Reporting: Print price lists directly from the module in PDF or XLS formats.
Customizable Filters: Use a simple wizard in the reporting menu to show or hide specific items and apply filters to the price list.
XLSX Integration: Works with the free "Base Report XLSX" module from Odoo Apps for Excel reports.
This module makes it easier for sales teams to work with price lists and share them with customers.
